## Documentation Tasks

### [DOC-001] Update notification-manager.md to reflect implemented reminders

**Context**: The `docs/explanation/notification-manager.md` file still lists "Task reminders (future feature)" in two places (lines 11 and 41). Reminders have been fully implemented (roadmap/completed/083-task-reminders.md) with CLI commands (`todoat reminder`), configuration options, and how-to documentation.

**Current text**:
- Line 11: "Task reminders (future feature)"
- Line 41: `| reminder | Task due date reminder (future) |`

**Required updates**:
- [x] Remove "(future feature)" and "(future)" annotations

**Impact**: Documentation consistency - user-facing docs reference a feature that explanation docs call "future".

**Created**: 2026-01-27
