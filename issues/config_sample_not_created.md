The config sample might be created, but it doesn't seem like the regular behaviour.

steps:
- (config already exist at ~/.config/todoat/config.yaml)
- Delete config
- launch `todoat` 
- No config created
- Launch `todoat l` (whrer 'l' is a list that had been created)
- a sample is created, but it doesn't contain all options like it should (this may be another issue)
